Performance tests for rendering large-ish tables, 20 at a time, with various javascript grid libraries.

<p>
The goal is to be able to have 20 open windows, each with a grid with as many rows of 25 columns as possible (300 is a nice target), each updating all cells every 2 seconds.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the grid must support:
<ul>
<li>At least minimal conditional formatting of the cells, e.g. "turn a cell red when the value exceeds 50"</li>
<li>Sorting - ultimately, we want the table to maintain the sort when the data is updated, though none of the current examples do this</li>
</ul>
Nice-to-haves include:
<ul>
 <li>Fixed Header</li>
 <li>Column Reording</li>
 <li>Hide/Show Columns</li>
</ul>
</p>
