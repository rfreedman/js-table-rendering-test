Performance tests for rendering large-ish tables, 20 at a time, with various javascript grid libraries.

The goal is to be able to have 20 open windows, each with a grid with as many rows of 25 columns as possible (300 is a nice target), each updating all cells every 2 seconds.

In addition, the grid must support:
* At least minimal conditional formatting of the cells, e.g. "turn a cell red when the value exceeds 50"
* Sorting - ultimately, we want the table to maintain the sort when the data is updated, though none of the current examples do this.

Nice-to-haves include:
* Fixed Header
* Column Reording
* Hide/Show Columns
